One of the main reasons I love coding is because there it gives me a full sense of control and I can personalize my code to be however I want.I have learned many languages including: Python, SQL, C, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Swift UI. I started out by completing Harvard's CS50 course and moved on from there, I watched as my code got more and more complicated, and it gave me a sense of achievement and purpose. My goals with coding are to build something that makes a difference in people's libe by sabing their time, prevent them from doing tedious tasks, etc. I can't wait to see where my coding journey takes me!</p>
